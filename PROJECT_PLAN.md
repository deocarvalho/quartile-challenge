## Success Criteria
- All CRUD operations working as expected
- RESTful conventions properly implemented
- Global multi-company support verified
- Proper error handling and logging
- Successful staging to production swap
- Complete Postman collection with tests
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges

## Notes
- Each step should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- Regular commits should be made to track progress
- Documentation should be updated as we progress
- Testing should be performed at each step
- Azure Functions Core Tools need to be installed for the Azure Function project

## Current Status
üü° In Progress - Initial setup completed, pending Azure Functions Core Tools installation
